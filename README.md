🔍 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐈 𝐃𝐢𝐝:
𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠: Cleaned and prepared data using libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn.
𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠: Trained a RandomForestClassifier model to make predictions on the dataset.
𝐄𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐦𝐥𝐢𝐭 𝐀𝐩𝐩: Developed a Streamlit web app to make the model interactive and user-friendly.
𝐃𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐨𝐧 𝐆𝐢𝐭𝐇𝐮𝐛: I’ve made the entire process available in a public GitHub repository, so you can clone it and try it for yourself!
💻 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐝:
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy)
Streamlit (for the web app)
GitHub (for version control and sharing the project)
👉 𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐦𝐥𝐢𝐭? Streamlit allows me to create a fast, simple, and interactive front-end for any machine learning model without having to worry about complex web development frameworks. It's perfect for showcasing models and sharing results interactively.
